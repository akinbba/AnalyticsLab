The serial number had been removed and replaced with a non-standard\\nnumber (probably from CDA computers). Consequently, the Apple repair man could\\nnot do ANY warrenty repairs.

Moral of the story, CAVEAT\\nEMPTOR.\\n\\nHowever, if you go with a reliable, trustworthy mail order firm (if they exist\\n- maybe someone could enlighten us with their experiences), you will probably\\nget a better price than your local educational outlet simply because mail order\\nout of state does not REQUIRE sales tax yet. Though for how much longer remains\\nto be seen. The addition in sales tax on a CPU purchase will probably wipe out\\nan educational discount. Again CAVEAT EMPTOR, some mail order companies DO\\ninclude sales tax on purchases even if they are out of state, so check!\\n\\nRichard.\\n \\\\\\\\/  Richard J Appleyard  f0975893@jaguar.csc.wsu.edu\\n /o o\\  Washington State University  \\n(   ) ) Voice (509) 335-7728  Fax (509) 335-9688 \\n \\_o_/  \"To err is human, but to really screw things up takes a computer!\"\\n                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            1\n",

In fact, it is often\\nchosen (besides its other merits) because it shoots like a revolver does\\nbasically.  It can limit the training time (read budget $$$) due to the\\nfact there are no 'external' safties other than the trigger, hence less\\ntraining time required. \\n\\n\\tSmith & Wesson (among other types) are chosen due to the fact taht\\nthey do have the external safties (hammer drop,as well as mag drop) which\\nif properly used have saved many lives when 'Mr. Bad' snatched the gun\\nfrom the officer and tried to shoot said officer the gun was on safe and\\nwould not fire.  This point had been made in many articles in various \\ngun magazines.  If fact, one author (can't remember who) staged a little\\ntest where he had a revolver and a S&W on safe laying on a table and asked\\npeople with little firearms experience to on his signal, grab the gun and\\nshoot a target.  He timed the people using each gun.  The revolver times\\nwere pretty close, but some of the times with the S&W were in minutes, or\\nthe person just gave up because they could not figure out the saftey.\\n\\n\\tYou don't often see Colt 45 autos issued due to the light trigger\\nwhich can be accidentally fired in a stress situation, opening the issuing\\ncity,county, etc.. to lawsuits, bad press, etc..\\n\\n\\tOf course any problem can be overcome with enough training, but\\nsuch training is not always available to budget crunched departments.  I\\nknow if I were a Cop I would want something like a S&W just for the off\\nchance of the gun getting taken away.  The safety doesn't guarantee that\\n'Mr. Bad' won't figure it out and shoot me, but it could buy enough time\\nto draw a second gun and shoot 'Mr. Bad' before it's too late.\\n\\n\\tDon't think I am too biassed here just because I have had 3 Glocks\\nin my possession at one time, because I have had a .45 as well.  In fact,\\nit was my first handgun.  Remember, the ultimate 'safety' is YOU the\\noperator, and no safety is going to stop an negligent discharge (note I\\ndon't say accidental) if you break the rules of gun handling.\\n\\n\\tAs per the part of being light weight and looking cool, I agree\\n100%.  I wouldn't rule it out as a first purchase.  \\n\\n-Just my $.02 + tax\\n-------   Steve Syck        syck5280@miller.cs.uwm.edu        --------\\n\\n    1\n",

Covington\\n\\nI do recall Watt making a comment to this effect, though it was quite a few\\nyears back and I can't cite the specifics.  I also recall that Cecil Andrus, who\\nwas Secretary of the Interior during the Carter Administration, responded\\nto Watt's comments by pointing out the stewardship role that God gave\\nto man, as recorded in Genesis.  Which makes me wonder: who are the\\ntrue conservatives?  It seems to me that a *conservative* should want to\\n*conserve* things of value for long-term societal benefit.  This form of\\n*conservation* should logically extend to the physical environment in \\nwhich people live, as well as the moral environment in which they relate\\nto one another and to God.\\n\\nIMHO, Watt's stewardship status is not enhanced by the fact that he served \\non the board of directors for Jim Bakker's organization, during a time in \\nwhich Bakker committed criminal acts which eventually landed Bakker \\nin federal prison.\\n\\nBob\\nrgolder@hoh.mbl.edu\\nJust another Baptist...\\n                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      1\n",
